    <td>A brief description of the movie</td>
    <td>Spanning 20 years and two continents, Mary and Max recounts the pen-pal relationship between two very different people: Mary Dinkle, a chubby, lonely eight-year-old living in the suburbs of Melbourne, Australia; and Max Horovitz, a severely obese, 44-year-old Jewish man with Asperger's syndrome living in the chaos of New York City.</td>
